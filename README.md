# Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model on AWS SageMaker

In this project, a recurrent neural network was created for determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. The model was deployed using Amazon's SageMaker service. A simple web app interacts with the deployed model. This project was done as a part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree course offered by Udacity.
